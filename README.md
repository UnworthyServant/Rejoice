### Rejoice in God through our Lord Jesus Christ

你们当以基督耶稣的心为心：腓立比书 2:5
Have this mind among yourselves, which is yours in Christ Jesus. Philippians 2:5

所以，弟兄们，我以　神的慈悲劝你们，将身体献上，当作活祭，是圣洁的，是　神所喜悦的；你们如此事奉乃是理所当然的。 不要效法这个世界，只要心意更新而变化，叫你们察验何为　神的善良、纯全、可喜悦的旨意。罗马书 12:1‭-‬2
I appeal to you therefore, brothers, by the mercies of God, to present your bodies as a living sacrifice, holy and acceptable to God, which is your spiritual worship. Do not be conformed to this world, but be transformed by the renewal of your mind, that by testing you may discern what is the will of God, what is good and acceptable and perfect. Romans 12:1‭-‬2

谁曾知道主的心去教导他呢？但我们是有基督的心了。
哥林多前书 2:16
"For who has understood the mind of the Lord so as to instruct him?" But we have the mind of Christ.
 1 Corinthians 2:16
