# Rejoice in God through our Lord Jesus Christ

More than that, we also rejoice in God through our Lord Jesus Christ, through whom we have now received reconciliation. Romans 5:11
不但如此，我们既借着我主耶稣基督得与　神和好，也就借着他以　神为乐。罗马书 5:11

要常常喜乐， 不住地祷告， 凡事谢恩；因为这是　神在基督耶稣里向你们所定的旨意。帖撒罗尼迦前书 5:16‭-‬18
Rejoice always, pray without ceasing, give thanks in all circumstances; for this is the will of God in Christ Jesus for you. 1 Thessalonians 5:16‭-‬18
